About this Project
A standard deck has 52 cards, and the number of ways you can arrange them is 52 factorial (52!) or 8×10⁶⁷.

That's 80,658,175,170,943,878,571,660,636,856,403,766,975,289,505,440,883,277,824,000,000,000,000
possible combinations.

To put it simply, every time you shuffle the deck, you are almost certainly creating an arrangement of cards that has never existed before in the history of the universe.

If your sequence matches partially or completely with someone else's, it shows up on the leaderboard.
